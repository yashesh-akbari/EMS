## **Future Enhancements**

- **Task Due Dates**: Adding due dates for tasks and notifications for pending tasks.
- **User Roles**: More detailed user roles with different access levels (e.g., Manager, Supervisor).
- **Backend Integration**: Currently, the system is a static front-end application. Future versions could integrate with a backend (e.g., Node.js/Express) to store employee data and task records.
